# P02 working notes (input for the handoff)

Deviations from the plan or spec, calls the spec leaves open, and follow-ups, recorded as they happen.

## Decisions the spec leaves open

- **Standard metadata is synced, not migrated (T01).** `syncStandardMetadata()` inserts whatever a tenant is
  missing from the catalogue (objects, fields, picklist values, a Master record type, default page and compact
  layouts, the record-number format, the All / Mine / Recently viewed list views) and records
  `tenant_settings.catalogue_version`. It runs at signup and in the seeds, and the metadata service (T02) runs it
  for any tenant behind `CATALOGUE_VERSION`, so existing organisations catch up without a data migration. It only
  ever inserts: admin renames, extra values and layout edits survive a later sync.
- **Defaults are named in the organisation's language (T01)**, like the built-in profiles in P01: layouts, the
  Master record type and system list views get their names from i18n at creation; picklist values keep a null
  label and are labelled from `picklists.<set>.<value>` until an admin renames them.
- **Picklist values are lower snake_case (T01).** Lead status and forecast category values also carry their system
  category (`OPEN`, `COMMIT`, …); reports, AI and forecasting use the category, admins rename only labels.
- **Field history settings are a column (T01).** §4.2 lists a `field_history_setting` table; a `track_history` flag
  on `field_definition` holds the same thing with one fewer join. The 60-per-object cap is a constraint trigger.
- **Layout assignments are overrides (T01).** Every object has one default page layout; `layout_assignment` rows
  exist only where a profile × record type should see a different one, so new profiles need no rows.
- **Auto-numbers use per-field sequences (T01).** `auto_number_next(field)` draws from a sequence created on first
  use (the `audit_next_seq` pattern), so concurrent creates never queue on a counter row. Numbers can have gaps, as
  in Salesforce.
